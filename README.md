# GPT-3 Test and Learn

Copied from https://blog.dspaces.io/2021/04/15/a-test-and-learn-approach-to-developing-with-openais-gpt-3/

I only changed it to work with a CSV instead of Google BigQuery

## How to use

Copy `example.csv` and change it to a `.env` file, fill it in with your Open AI key.

Set up a virtual environment
`python -m venv venv`
`venv\Scripts\activate` (windows) or `source env/bin/activate` (mac)

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
